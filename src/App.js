// 1. You must make a single page application (only one index.html file)
// using create-react-app.

// 2. Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your
// code well organized.

// 3. There should be at least 3 client-side routes using React Router
// Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to
// navigate between routes.

// 4. Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and
// make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Use a form
// to make your post request, specifically a controlled form/component.
// Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API
// but it is not required. You should keep your json-server data simple:
// avoid nested data and associations. You'll learn how to work with
// more complex data in the next two phases. Focus on the frontend for
// this project.

// 5. Add some styling: you're encouraged to write your CSS from scratch,
// either by using styled components or writing CSS files and using
// id/className to style your elements. You can also incorporate a UI
// framework (like React Bootstrap, Semantic UI , or Material UI) if
// you prefer.
